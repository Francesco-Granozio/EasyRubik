# EasyRubik

A Unity-based Rubikâ€™s Cube simulator and solver inspired by Megalomattâ€™s work, leveraging the Kociemba algorithm to provide fast and reliable solutions. This project extends the original by adding user-friendly enhancements, including a **Hint** feature that suggests the next optimal move to guide players through the solve.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Realistic 3D Rubikâ€™s Cube**: Interactive, rotatable cube with smooth animations and accurate sticker colors.
- **Kociemba Solver Integration**: Uses the two-phase Kociemba algorithm (via Megalomattâ€™s [Kociemba implementation](https://github.com/Megalomatt/Kociemba)) for solving any arbitrary scramble.
- **Hint System**: Unique to this projectâ€”press the **Hint** button at any time to reveal the next best move toward the cubeâ€™s solution.
- **Step-by-Step Solve Playback**: Watch the cube solve itself move by move, with adjustable speed.
- **Custom Scrambles & Timing**: Generate random scrambles and track your solve time to practice and improve.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, and WebGL builds.
