# EasyRubik
A Unity-based Rubik’s Cube simulator and solver inspired by Megalomatt’s work, leveraging the Kociemba algorithm to provide fast and reliable solutions. This project extends the original by adding user-friendly enhancements, including a Hint feature that suggests the next optimal move to guide players through the solve.
